        <p><strong>The Neat Whisky Connoisseur</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sip, Swirl, and Self-Appraise</strong></p>
        <p>Meet the "neat whisky enthusiast" who prefers their dram untamed, just like their ego. Choosing "neat"
            doesn't
            just describe their drink; it's a lifestyle choice. They're
            the type to tell you, "I like my
            whisky neat," as if it's a profound
            life philosophy.</p>
        <p>But hey, at least they take their whisky as seriously as they take themselves.</p>
        <p>Cheers to a neat character!</p>
